This LUD extends the `payRequest` API to enrich fiat-to-btc, btc-to-fiat and fiat-to-fiat seeming transfers through Lightning. It achieves that by adding optional metadata and parameters to the already existing [LUD6](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md) APIs: `sourceExchangeData` and `targetExchangeData`, regarding the price paid for the Bitcoin being sent and the price the Bitcoin just received will be sold, respectively.

The experience works as follows: someone wants to send 10 GBP to the USA and credit the target account in USD.

The `WALLET` makes a request following the [`payRequest`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md) spec, including extra information about the desired target fiat currency as a query parameter.

The `SERVICE` then decides if it can fulfill such exchange and returns `targetExchangeData` in case it can, including a promised price of exchange and an expiry for the promise.

The `WALLET` shows the price back to the user along with it's own price exchange information, telling how much many USD would arrive at `SERVICE` for 10 GBP.

Upon confirmation, `WALLET` performs the exchange from GBP, calls the `SERVICE` back on the callback URL passing as a query parameter, along the sats amount bought, the `sourceExchangeData`, including the price related to the exchange and the currency.

The `SERVICE` then generates the invoice that, when paid, will be converted into USD, completing the fiat-to-fiat transfer. If the conversion cannot be executed on the `SERVICE`, the invoice should be cancelled. So invoice settlement means the user received the USD.

## Pay to static QR/NFC/link

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. User scans a LNURL QR code or pastes/shares an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
2. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL including currency as a query parameter.
    `lightning:LNURL..?currency=USD`
3. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:

    ```Typescript
    {
        "callback": string, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters.
        "maxSendable": number, // Max millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive.
        "minSendable": number, // Min millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive, can not be less than 1 or more than `maxSendable`.
        "metadata": string, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string here, this is required to pass signature verification at a later step.
        "tag": "payRequest", // Type of LNURL.
        "targetExchangeData": {
            "currency": string, // The currency passed as query, as confirmation that it is accepted.
            "price": number,  // The sell price promised for the received Bitcoin in given currency.
            "expiry": number, // The number of seconds provided callback and price is valid.
        }
    }
    ```

    If `SERVICE` supports `LUD-21` and cannot perform the exchange, then an error must be returned.
    If `SERVICE` returns a payload without `targetExchangeData`, it must be because it doesn't support `LUD-21`.

3. `LN WALLET` displays a payment dialog where user can specify an amount in the fiat currency supported by the wallet:

	```
	max can send = min(maxSendable, local estimation of how much sats the given amount is)
	min can send = max(minSendable, local minimal value allowed by wallet)
	```

    Additionaly, the wallet is able to show how much target currency the given amount would be exchanged into.
    The amount of target fiat currency received would be calculated as follows:
        `amount / sourceExchangeData.price * targetExchangeData.price`

4. Upon user confirmation, `LN WALLET` buys the sats and makes a GET request using

	```
	<callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi><?|&>sourceExchangeData=<urlencode({json object})>
	```

    `amount` being the amount of milisats to be sent after successful conversion.

    `sourceExchangeData` being an optional parameter with the following format

    ```Typescript
    {
        "currency": string, // The currency the Bitcoin was bought with.
        "price": number, // The price paid to buy the Bitcoin in the source currency.
    }
    ```

    If omitted, the `SERVICE` performs the conversion without knowing the source currency.
    If provided, the `SERVICE` is able to provide richer information about the conversion flow.

5. `LN Service` takes the GET request and returns JSON response of form:

	```Typescript
	{
	    pr: string, // bech32-serialized lightning invoice
        routes: [] // an empty array
	}
	```

    The invoice returned should be cancellable in case the sell cannot be done on `SERVICE`.
    The invoice settlement must mean the exchange was successful on `SERVICE`.

6. `LN WALLET` Verifies that `h` tag in provided invoice is a hash of `metadata` string converted to byte array in UTF-8 encoding.
7. `LN WALLET` Verifies that amount in provided invoice equals the amount previously specified by user.
8. `LN WALLET` pays the invoice, no additional user confirmation is required at this point.
9. `LN SERVICE` receives the payment and automatically converts the BTC into the currency `LN WALLET` specified when making the `payRequest`, crediting the `LN SERVICE` user in fiat, not in BTC.
