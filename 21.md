LUD-21: Exchange information in payRequest protocol.
===============================

This LUD extends the `payRequest` API to include information about the currency used to buy the Bitcoin being sent, the currency the Bitcoin will be converted to and the price of exchange for each one. It works as a metadata extension to represent intention of exchange from the sender's side and willingness to receive in fiat for the receiver's side, enriching fiat-to-btc, btc-to-fiat and especially fiat-to-fiat transfers using Lightning.

The experience works as follows: someone wants to send £ 10 to the USA and credit the target account in USD.

The `WALLET` makes a request following the [`payRequest`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md) spec, including an extra information about the desired target fiat currency as a query parameter.

The `SERVICE` then decides if it can fulfill such exchange and returns `targetExchangeData` in case it can, including a price hint and a fee hint. The price hint should be as close as possible to the exchange price that would be paid if the exchange was being done at present, but it isn't a price guarantee. The fee hint is an optional percentage used to inform the sender how much the `SERVICE` would charge for the exchange.

The `WALLET` shows the hints back to the user along with it's own price exchange information, telling approximately how much many Dollars would arrive at `SERVICE` for £10. Upon confirmation, `WALLET` performs the exchange from pounds, calls the `SERVICE` back on the callback URL passing as a query parameter the `sourceExchangeData`, including the actual price and fee related to the exchange and the currency the sats were exchanged from.

The `SERVICE` then generates the invoice that, when paid, will be converted into Dollars, completing the fiat-to-fiat transfer. The metadata provided on the callback will enable the `SERVICE` to show the transfer as a remittance payment if it wants to, showing data about the source curency and price.

## Pay to static QR/NFC/link

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. User scans a LNURL QR code or pastes/shares an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
2. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL including currency as a query parameter.
    `lightning:LNURL..?currency=BRL`
3. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:

    ```Typescript
    {
        "callback": string, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters.
        "maxSendable": number, // Max millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive.
        "minSendable": number, // Min millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive, can not be less than 1 or more than `maxSendable`.
        "metadata": string, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string here, this is required to pass signature verification at a later step.
        "tag": "payRequest", // Type of LNURL.
        "targetExchangeData": {
            "currency": string, // The currency passed as query, as confirmation that it is accepted.
            "priceHint": number,  // The most accurate possible Bitcoin sell price in given currency.
            "feeHint": number | null // A percentage that will be charged by `SERVICE` for the exchange. Range: [0-1]
        }
    }
    ```

    If `SERVICE` supports `LUD-21` and cannot perform the exchange, then an error must be returned.
    If `SERVICE` returns a payload without `targetExchangeData`, it must be because it doesn't support `LUD-21`.

3. `LN WALLET` displays a payment dialog where user can specify an amount in the fiat currency supported by the wallet:

	```
	max can send = min(maxSendable, local estimation of how much sats the given amount is)
	min can send = max(minSendable, local minimal value allowed by wallet)
	```

    Additionaly, the wallet is able to show how much, approximately, target currency the given amount would be exchanged into.
    The amount of target fiat currency deposited would be calculated approximately as follows:
        `sourceAmount / sourcePrice * (1 - sourceFee) * priceHint * (1 - feeHint)`

4. Upon user confirmation, `LN WALLET` buys the sats and makes a GET request using

	```
	<callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi><?|&>sourceExchangeData=<urlencode({json object})>
	```

    `amount` being the amount of milisats to be sent after successful conversion.

    `sourceExchangeData` being an optional parameter with the following format

    ```Typescript
    {
        "currency": string, // The currency the sats were bought with.
        "price": number, // The exact price paid to buy the BTC in the source currency.
        "fee": number | null // The exact percentage fee the `LN WALLET` has charged to convert BTC to currency.
    }
    ```

    If omitted, the `SERVICE` performs the conversion without knowing the source currency.
    If provided, the `SERVICE` is able to provide richer information about the conversion flow.

5. `LN Service` takes the GET request and returns JSON response of form:

	```Typescript
	{
	    pr: string, // bech32-serialized lightning invoice
        routes: [] // an empty array
	}
	```

6. `LN WALLET` Verifies that `h` tag in provided invoice is a hash of `metadata` string converted to byte array in UTF-8 encoding.
7. `LN WALLET` Verifies that amount in provided invoice equals the amount previously specified by user.
8. `LN WALLET` pays the invoice, no additional user confirmation is required at this point.
9. `LN SERVICE` receives the payment and automatically converts the BTC into the currency `LN WALLET` specified when making the `payRequest`, crediting the `LN SERVICE` user in fiat, not in BTC.

## Notes on price hints and better user experience

The interaction described in this document never provides any sort of guarantees about price. That said, the closer the `SERVICE` and `WALLET` can get the hints to the actual exchange price, the better the end user experience. This means `SERVICE` should try to give as precise as possible price hints while `WALLET` should refresh the hints as needed during the user transfer flow.
