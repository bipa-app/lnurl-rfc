LUD-24: `remittanceRequest` base spec.
===============================

`author: luizParreira`

Remittance Request extends the `payRequest` API to include information about the currency being sent, the price to exchange Bitcoin for that currency and the currency the user wants to receive the payment in.

The idea here is that a wallet can scan a static QR code or click on a static LNURL address and get back details about a remittance that is expected. The details may include much more extensive metadata than a normal Lightning invoice, and information about the currencies being exchanged and the BTC price on each. And the amounts may be fixed or within a range.

Then, once the user accepts the terms (and choose an amount, if that is not fixed), the wallet will call the service and get a Lightning invoice specific for that payment, containing a hash of the metadata as its [`h` tag (`description_hash`)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md#requirements-3) and proceed to pay the invoice if it matches the expected amount and hash. Once the service receives the BTC, it will automatically convert the

## Pay to static QR/NFC/link

### Wallet to service interaction flow:

1. User scans a LNURL QR code or pastes/shares an `lightning:LNURL..` link with `LN WALLET` and `LN WALLET` decodes LNURL.
2. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request to `LN SERVICE` using the decoded LNURL.
3. `LN WALLET` tells how much
3. `LN WALLET` gets JSON response from `LN SERVICE` of form:

    ```Typescript
    {
        "callback": string, // The URL from LN SERVICE which will accept the pay request parameters
        "maxSendable": number, // Max millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive
        "minSendable": number, // Min millisatoshi amount LN SERVICE is willing to receive, can not be less than 1 or more than `maxSendable`
        "metadata": string, // Metadata json which must be presented as raw string here, this is required to pass signature verification at a later step
        "tag": "remittanceRequest", // Type of LNURL
        "remittanceData": {
            "currency": string, // The currency the `LN SERVICE` supports
            "priceHint": number,  // The current BTC sell price in the given currency
            "feeHint": number // A hint of the fee `LN SERVIVE` will charge when receiving the Bitcoin and converting to currency. Number must be a percentage between 0 and 1.
        }
    }
    ```
    or

    ```JSON
    {"status": "ERROR", "reason": "error details..."}
    ```

    `metadata` json array must contain one `text/plain` entry, all other types of entries are optional.
    `metadata` json array must contain either one `image/png;base64` entry or one `image/jpeg;base64` entry or neither.

    The `metadata` json array is only allowed to contain arrays. The first item of an array inside the `metadata` array is always a string representing the metadata type while any item that follows can be of any JSON type. Implementors MUST NOT assume it will always be a string.

    ```Typescript
    [
        [
            "text/plain", // mandatory,
            string // short description displayed when paying and in transaction log
        ],
        [
            "text/long-desc", // optional
            string // longer description of the payment, MAY contain newlines
        ],
        [
            "image/png;base64",
            string // base64 string, optional 512x512px PNG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid. Up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        [
            "image/jpeg;base64", // optional
            string // base64 string, 512x512px JPG thumbnail which will represent this lnurl in a list or grid. Up to 136536 characters (100Kb of image data in base-64 encoding)
        ],
        // future entries:
        [
            string,
            any
        ]
    ]
    ```

    and be sent as a string:

    ```JSON
    "[[\"text/plain\", \"lorem ipsum blah blah\"]]"
    ```

3. `LN WALLET` displays a payment dialog where user can specify an exact sum in the currency supported by the wallet:

	```
	max can send = min(maxSendable, local estimation of how much sats the given amount is)
	min can send = max(minSendable, local minimal value allowed by wallet)
	```
	Additionally, a payment dialog must include:
	- Domain name extracted from `LNURL` query string.
	- A way to view the metadata sent of `text/plain` format.

    And it may include:
    - An image element with the contents of `image/png` or `image/jpeg`.

4. `LN WALLET` makes a GET request using

	```
	<callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi><?|&>remittanceData=<urlencode({json object})>
	```

    `amount` being the amount of milisats to be sent.

    `remittanceData` The JSON object MUST be of the following format:

    ```Typescript
    {
        "currency": string, // The currency the remittance is coming from. Ex. USD, EUR
        "price": number, // The price paid to buy the BTC in the given currency
        "fee": number // The fee the `LN WALLET` has charged to convert BTC to Currency. Number must be a percentage between 0 and 1.
    }
    ```

5. `LN Service` takes the GET request and returns JSON response of form:

	```Typescript
	{
	    pr: string, // bech32-serialized lightning invoice
        routes: [] // an empty array
	}
	```

	or

	```JSON
	{"status":"ERROR", "reason":"error details..."}
	```

6. `LN WALLET` Verifies that `h` tag in provided invoice is a hash of `metadata` string converted to byte array in UTF-8 encoding.
7. `LN WALLET` Verifies that amount in provided invoice equals the amount previously specified by user.
10. `LN WALLET` pays the invoice, no additional user confirmation is required at this point.
11. `LN SERVICE` receives the payment and automatically converts the BTC into the currency `LN WALLET` specified when making the `remittanceRequest`. It is important to note that `LN SERVICE` must support the conversion of BTC to the specified currency.

## Notes on metadata for server-side LNURL-PAY

### When client makes a first call:

Construct a metadata object, turn it into json, then include it into parent json as a string.

### When client makes a second call

1. Make a hash as follows: `sha256(utf8ByteArray(unescaped_metadata_string))`.
2. Generate a payment request using an obtained hash.
